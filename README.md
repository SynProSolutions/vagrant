# SynProSolutions' Vagrant repository

## Purpose

This repository provides everything what's needed to easily get Virtualbox VMs powered with Debian (lenny, squeeze, wheezy, jessie, stretch, buster + bullseye) 64bit up and running.
We - [SynPro Solutions](https://synpro.solutions/?vagrant) - use this setup to design and test system changes before deploying them to our customers.

## Requirements

* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
* [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

## Setup instructions

Start one plain Debian buster system:

```
% vagrant up buster1 && vagrant ssh buster1
```

NOTE: Just replace `buster` with the Debian release you want to use (`lenny`, `squeeze`, `wheezy`, `jessie`, `stretch`, `buster` + `bullseye` being available).

Nine nodes for each Debian release have been pre-defined (e.g. buster1, buster2, buster3,..., buster9).
If you need three Debian buster systems (e.g. to test things like H/A or CEPH):

```
% vagrant up buster{1,2,3} && vagrant ssh buster1
```

You can connect between the systems by ssh-ing as user `vagrant` with password `vagrant` (e.g. `ssh vagrant@buster2` from buster1 system).

## Vagrant's base box file

The `debian64_lenny.box`, `debian64_squeeze.box`, `debian64_wheezy.box`, `debian64_jessie.box`, `debian64_stretch.box`, `debian64_buster.box` + `debian64_bullseye.box` files which are used for the Debian VMs by Vagrant are generated by [grml-debootstrap](https://github.com/grml/grml-debootstrap) (visit its `packer/` directory for further details).
